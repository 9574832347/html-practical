        The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in
        a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages
        such as JavaScript.

        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into
        multimedia web pages. <abbr title="hyper text mark up language and used for set web page">HTML</abbr> describes
        the structure of a web
